# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Automation Project üõ°Ô∏è

As AI becomes more prevalent in cybersecurity operations, I wanted to explore the idea of how automation could assist in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.
This project simulates a small SOC setup & demonstrates how tools like Splunk, n8n, OpenAI, and Slack can work together to detect, analyze, and automatically respond to security events.

This project was inspired by the following video:

## Tools Used

- VMWare Workstation - Windows 11 25H2 / Ubuntu
- Splunk
- n8n
- OpenAI
- Slack

## Project Objectives

- Create virtual machines, including a Windows 11 machine & 2 Ubuntu servers to simulate a SOC Environment.
- Install Splunk & n8n on the Ubuntu machines.
- Configure Splunk to receive telemetry & logs from the Windows 11 machine.
- Set up communication between Splunk & n8n to automate workflows based on alerts.
- Integrate OpenAI into n8n to generate responses to simulated attacks.
- Send the AI-generated responses & alerts to Slack.

## Setup

The initial setup included downloading VMware Workstation and creating the virtual machines that would be needed for the project. I started with the Windows 11 machine, as this will be the machine that sends its telemetry and logs over to Splunk.

After the Windows 11 machine was downloaded and running, I created a snapshot in case anything were to happen, so that the base Windows 11 machine could be restored if needed. I then moved on to the Ubuntu server that would host Splunk. This was done by using the command line on Ubuntu and using the wget link provided on Splunk's site after creating an account.

Once installed, I could go over to my host machine's browser and enter the Ubuntu VM's IP address and the port number 8000 (Splunk's default web interface port number) to reach the Splunk interface and sign in with the credentials I created.

With Splunk up, there were a few things that needed to be configured, such as creating a new index that would eventually display the Windows 11 telemetry and logs.

However, I needed to connect the Windows 11 VM and the Splunk instance, so I went back to the Splunk website and got the install for the Splunk forwarder. This would allow the information to be sent over to Splunk once configured properly.

Now that Splunk is receiving the telemetry and logs, I could test to ensure that Splunk would receive the brute force attack attempt. This was done by simply trying to RDP into the Windows 11 machine unsuccessfully with the wrong password. 

This can then be found using the 'EventCode=4625' query to narrow the logs down to unsuccessful Window logon attempts.

I could now move on to the second Ubuntu machine to install n8n, which would help organize the workflow and will connect Splunk, OpenAI, and Slack together.

After n8n was installed, I went back over to Splunk and created a webhook with the wanted alert, in this case, the brute force attempt, so that it could be implemented into n8n's workflow.

Test to ensure the webhook works correctly with the provided alert on Splunk 'Test-Brute-Force'.

To start automating the workflow, I needed to implement OpenAI into n8n using 'OpenAI - Message a model' node to connect to the webhook created. This is also where the prompts can be created for what you want AI to display based on the alert. 

In this case, I wanted a summary, any threat intelligence information based on the known threat, the severity of the attack, and recommended actions for the attack. This is also where I could add information for the AI to detect, such as the ComputerName, src_ip, user, and count.

With the AI prompt setup, I moved over to Slack to create an alerts channel that would output the AI responses. I then added a Slack node into n8n and executed the node with the message 'test' to ensure the response would be sent over to Slack.

<img width="1628" height="630" alt="SlackTest" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7b6968c-11bd-4053-a990-cdaa304f954c" />

After confirming that n8n would send its response to Slack, I could then test using the RDP failed logon attempts from earlier to see what the AI response would be to the threat.

<img width="1915" height="968" alt="FirstAIResponseAttempt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806a933a-5a8c-472c-9bbb-6f64e1908d20" />

The responses were working correctly and now I wanted to test the same attack, however, because I was testing the attack through my host machine, it wouldn't give any threat intelligence, as it would only give the private IP address.

To give it a better response, I took out the original source IP (the private IP address used) and hardcoded a malicious source IP into the response from the site 'AbuseIPDB', which tracks malicious IP addresses. 

This was the IP address that I used.

Before I could use this, I had to add AbuseIPDB to the workflow in n8n for additional information on the IP address, leaving the final workflow looking like this.

After running this final workflow with the hardcoded malicious IP address, this was the response that AI gave for this simulated brute force attack.
